# Classification Challenge Using Spam Data
My coding project uses the Pandas Library of Python in Jupyter Notebook to access spam email data from a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL, that downloads a CSV file.

## Process:
To begin, open the spam_detector-checkpoint.ipynb file in a source code editor that supports Jupyter Notebook files. Each cell has Python code within it. Use the play button outside the top left corner of each cell to run each cell. You can also click inside the cell and press Shift + Enter to run the cell and move down to the next cell. The output of each cell displays what the comment requests and uses the Pandas Library of the Python coding language.
